# DevR
###DEVeloper Redefined - A retro word processor written in the Borland C++ 5.0 compiler as a high school project.

DevR is a word processor which can be used to work with text files. Files on drives can be viewed, created, deleted, appended, encrypted and decrypted. A history of all the commands is saved in a file called 'core'. It can be prevented by using command '_INCOGNITO_1'. Once on, no history of the commands typed will be saved. This can be used for anonymity.

Some other features include the ability to manage a list of important files in a library. One can also change the color of the console window to select the best suiting scheme.
